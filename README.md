## The original crackmeup has transmogrified into the [CrackMeUp Twitter Bot](https://github.com/bholagabbar/crackmeup-bot) and the [CrackMeUp Joke API](https://github.com/bholagabbar/crackmeup-api)! Say hi to the bot on twitter  and find the API at [crackmeup-api.herokuapp.com](crackmeup-api.herokuapp.com).
